# Performance monitoring in k8s

This repo will host code to accompany an article about using 
[cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor) with Prom/Graf to 
obtain detailed performance stats inside k8s.

A key focus will be on QoS classes, particularly on understanding how 
the `requests` / `limits` of a QoS-guaranteed pod are being consumed.
